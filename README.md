### World Happiness Report

The World Happiness Report focuses on the wellbeing of human beings across all regions in the world. This dataset will help us uncover patterns and insights across the world. We will focus on the data of 2021 to see factors that determine happiness in a given region.

#### Libraries used

<ol>
    <li>Pandas</li>
    <li>Numpy</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
    <li>Seaborn</li>
</ol>

#### Data Cleaning

I renamed some columns to make the easy to read and understand what it contains. For example i renamed **Regional Indicator** to **Region** to represent all the regions/continents.
I then made some plots to show how different variables in the dataset are related.

#### Findings and Patterns

Some of the key determinants of happiness in the dataset include :
<ul>
    <li>Freedom to make lif choices</li>
    <li>Health life expectancy</li>
    <li>Social support</li>
    <li>Perceptions of corruption</li>
</ul>

Countries/Regions displaying low levels of happiness in the dataset have displayed low level of helath life expectancy, very high corruption rates among other things. While countries displaying high levels of happines have shown to have low levels of corruption and high level of life expectancy.

In summary, many factors determine the happiness of a region ranging from  economic to social factors and many more.
